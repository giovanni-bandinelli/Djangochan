## To-do

A list of missing features etc from the moment I wrote this README

### Frontend wise
- [ ] Overhaul of the UI/UX
   - [ ] Implement markdown (greentext,hyperlinks,other?)
   - [ ] Implement draggable reply form
   - [ ] Polish the look and feel of the standard webapp, make it more responsive
   - [ ] Implement a mobile friendly version
   - [x] Deconstruct the spaghetti code that is the frontend side of the application, organize it better

### Backend wise
- [x] Merge Thread and Post model so that they share the same ID
- [ ] Add user model, both anonymous and logged (for admin and mods)

I'll add more stuff going on.

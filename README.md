## Installation
Assuming that you already have git and python installed:  

1.**Clone the repository**

Go in whatever directory you want to download the repository and clone it with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/giovanni-bandinelli/DjangoChan.git
```
**Note:** Some directories ( './static' at root level '.static/core' inside 'core' app) are specified in the `.gitignore` file and will not be included when you clone the repository

2.**Create and activate a python virtual enviroment**

I called mine 'vEnv', remember to change the .gitignore accordingly 
```bash
python -m venv vEnv
```

3.**Add requirements**
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
**important**
I'm using postgres as my DBMS so you should either install it (if it's not already present on your machine) and create a database matching the infos inside the 'DATABASE = {}' section
in settings.py or tweak them to fit your needs, even changing DBMS should go fairly smooth i'm pretty sure.

4.**Run migrations**
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
## Usage
After completing the installation,open a terminal inside of the project's directory and run:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
et voil√†

**reminder**

This repository is still in development stage, Work on deployment mode hasn't started yet 
## Contributing 
At the moment I want this to be a solo project and no contributions will be accepted

## To-do

A list of missing features etc from the moment I wrote this README

### Frontend wise
- [ ] Overhaul of the UI/UX
   - [ ] Implement markdown (greentext,hyperlinks,other?)
   - [ ] Implement draggable reply form
   - [ ] Polish the look and feel of the standard webapp, make it more responsive
   - [ ] Implement a mobile friendly version
   - [ ] Deconstruct the spaghetti code that is the frontend side of the application, organize it better

### Backend wise
- [ ] Merge Thread and Post model so that they share the same ID
- [ ] Add user model, both anonymous and logged (for admin and mods)

I'll add more stuff going on.
